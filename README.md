# TickTock
This is the final project for CS63 ARVR development. I collaborated with other two designer and one developer. I was responsible for the second scene(past scene) development except the photo frame and oven.
The final apk is "FinalBuildForTechnigala.apk". 
The final scene on a platform with a cube is to reset the game to scene1 for presentation purpose. It's not part of the game experience.
